### Bug fix

**You own this task. Plan, review, verify.** Investigate and fix directly, or delegate when authorized and useful.

Be scientific. Every shipped line traces to runtime evidence. Belt-and-suspenders that "might help" is a hypothesis, not a fix. It does not ship. When evidence refutes a hypothesis, revert what it motivated. The smallest change the evidence justifies ships, nothing more.

1. Reproduce it yourself on the matching surface via the control skill (Non-negotiables), even when a debug or instrumentation protocol says to ask the user to reproduce. Ask the user only with a stated, specific reason the control surface cannot reach the target, and only after driving it as far as it goes. If it won't reproduce directly, synthesize the trigger, tighten conditions, or instrument until it fires.
2. Binary-search the cause. Form the candidate hypotheses, then rule them out until one survives. Seed them with `how` over the affected subsystem and the **why** skill for regression history. Each pass, take the split that cuts the most remaining problem space, get runtime evidence, eliminate. When program state is unclear, add instrumentation or logging and read it as the code runs. Don't guess. Drive a long or stubborn hunt with the active runtime scheduler, only when recurring work is requested. Confirm the surviving *mechanism* with runtime evidence before the step-3 architect/interrogate fan-out.
3. Plan the fix. Use `architect` when materially different designs need comparison. Implement directly or delegate when authorized and useful using your configured bug-fix model (default `inherit-parent`) with a specific scope.
4. Verify on the same surface. The original repro now passes. "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it. Unit tests show branch behavior, not bug absence.
5. Use **tdd** when the bug has a cheap local regression test. Capture the failure before the fix and rerun afterward. Commit the sequence only when requested or already authorized.
6. Report the result and verification. Follow project conventions for commits or PRs only when requested.

**Reply:** what was broken, root cause, fix, how you verified. Paste failing-then-passing repro output verbatim.
